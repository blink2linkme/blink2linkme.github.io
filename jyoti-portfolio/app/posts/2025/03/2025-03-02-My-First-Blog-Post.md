## Reflecting on My Journey as a Developer

Welcome to my very first post! I am incredibly excited to share this milestone with you all. While this post may be more of personal reflection, it is something I am writing for myself as a reminder of how far I have come and where I plan to head.

This website represents the realization of a long-held dream. I have always envisioned creating a platform where I can share my journey, my learnings, and the experiences that have shaped my growth over time. It is my hope that this blog will not only serve as a personal reference in the future but also provide valuable insights that may benefit others.

My journey as a developer began many years ago with QBASIC, the first programming language I ever encountered. Although I was introduced to programming at a young aga, I did not fully grasp its potential until the advent of mobile technology. My initial goal was to develop mobile applications similar to mig33, a project I never completed. Despite not having yet created something truly exceptional, I remain hopeful that one day I will build a product that will be widely used and appreciated.

In this project, I am developing my own website to present information about myself, along with links to download my CV and resume. Additionally, I will include sections where I document my daily experiences and learning related to coding and other areas of personal development.

This website offers an opportunity to enhance my coding skills by creating something tangible. I plan to revisit it as a resource whenever I need to refresh my knowledge. Furthermore, I hop that this project will help me improve my reading and writing skills, as I sometimes find it challeging to engage with documentation and more detailed resources.

I am eager to see where this path will lead and look forward to sharing my progress with you all.
